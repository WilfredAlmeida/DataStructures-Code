1. Symmetric Matrix:
    Matrix where elements at indexes I[i,j] == I[j,i].
    So if we know value at I[i,j], we can also know value at I[j,i].
    So 1D array is used and elements in either lower triangle or upper trianglr are
    stored in 1D array. Not Coded :(:

2. Did not code Upper Triangular Matrix.

3. Topelitz Matrix: See Video Abdul Bari DS.
